            <h2>One Stop Shop</h2>
            <p>Hi there! Welome to Mandisa&apos;s Kitchen! I am so happy you stopped by. This is a place where you will find healthy and tasty recipes to make for yourself and your family.
                I have found that sometimes we scroll endlessly on social media and save recipes that we never come back to! However, I want to personally provide you with a one stop shop for recipes that
                I KNOW you will like and are worth trying. Let's dive in shall we! </p>

<!--Section 2 About Me-->
        <section>
            <div class="aboutme">
            <h2>Hey...Who&apos;s in the Kitchen!</h2>
            <p>As you can already tell, it is me, Mandisa! I find being in the kitchen is where I find peace and where my love just overflows into the meals that I prepare. I was born
                and raised in Kansas City and to this day I still stay in the area. The Kansas City area provides you with a nice balance of country and city life. One weekend, you can find yourself out on the 
                farm looking up to the sky and counting the stars and then the next taking an uber to go downtown. 
            </p>
            <p>When I am not in the kitchen or finding amazing recipes, you will find me doing a few different things. Such as..</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Working full-time as a Provider Enrollment Specialist.</li>
                <li>Attending online school part-time for Web Development.</li>
                <li>Studying for school and the Bible.</li>
                <li>Spending time with family and friends.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Oh! All while trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle such as working out, taking small emotional and mental breaks and eating healthy too! I have worked as a Provider Enrollment Specialist for over 5 years now and I made the choice
                to change careers and pursue an education in Information Technology (IT). With that being said it was through my coursework that I realized Web Development was the path that I wanted to move forward with.
                I will have to say I have learned so much and I will continue to learn.
