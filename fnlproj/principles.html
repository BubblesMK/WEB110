            <h2>Key Principles</h2>
            <img class="img2" src="images/img2.png" alt="an illustration of someone thinking about the concepts of UX principles">       
            <p class="box">You will notice that when you search for core principles for UX designs you will find tons of information. It can be quite overwhelming.
                However, I have taken the liberty to research and find the top 7 principles that I believe should be noted. Take a look!</p>
        <!--principle of UX design-->
        <h3>User-Centered (Centricity)</h3>
            <p class="box">Focus on the needs and goals of the user FIRST when creating your product. 
            Research and test your product to figure out what it is that your user(s) is looking for and how it will help them. 
            </p>
        
        <!--principle of UX design-->
        <h3>Usability</h3>
            <p class="box">How easy is your product to use? Can a user easily navigate your site swiftly and find what they need? Did the user have a positive experience while visiting your website? 
                These are all questions that you as the developer can ask during testing to see if your website is easy to use. 
            </p>
            <p class="box">Below are five components of useability that you can consider: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Learnability</li>
                <li>Efficiency</li>
                <li>Memorability</li>
                <li>Errors</li>
                <li>Satisfaction</li>
            </ul>
            </section>
        
            <section class="column"> <!--Second column-->
        <!--principle of UX design-->
        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
            <p class="box">Offer a way to ensure everyone with a variety of circumstances can use and access your website. 
                For example, consider screen readers, keyboard navigation, and including sharp contrast colors to help those who are visual impaired. 
            </p>
            <div class="external"> <!--a div element is being used for this instance since there is no heading element being utilized-->
            <p class="box">Below are a few examples of websites that apply the principle of accessibility.</p>
            <!--the links listed below are external links that will leave the website-->
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://ilovepeanutbutter.com/">Peanut Butter & Co</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://sweetkick.com/">sweetkick</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://laservue.com/">LaserVue</a></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        <!--principle of UX design-->
        <h3>Consistency</h3>
            <p class="box">This principle is quite simple and straightforward and that is to stay consistent. For example, if the style of your website is business or playful, stick with one and do not alternate. 
                Stay consistent with the design, when you switch up your design it can cause confusion which will lead to the user leaving your site. 
            </p>
        
        <!--principle of UX design-->
        <h3>Hierarchy</h3>
        <p class="box">How will the user navigate your website is the question that we as developers must ask ourselves? That is where the hierarchy comes in. You want to make sure the user can view and access the most valuable information first. For example, if your website is for someone who needs to book a party at a recreation center, you would not want your first navigation link to be for events taken place at the center. 
            You would want the first navigation to link to be for booking a room and/or information about the pricing. 
        </p>

        <!--principle of UX design-->
        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p class="box">Consider how and where the user will view your website. 
            Will they view it on a tablet, mobile device, or desktop? Due to the varied sizes of devices, your site will look different. In other words, try to understand where the user will use your website.
        </p>

        <!--principle of UX design-->
        <h3>User Control</h3>
        <p class="box">Give a way for the user to have just enough control over their experience with your site. 
            For example, if you have a call to action (CTA) give the user the flexibility to decline the CTA or if they want to revisit the CTA give them the option.
